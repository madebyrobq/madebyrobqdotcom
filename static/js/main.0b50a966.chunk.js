If an edge is directed up, it needs to be sliced based on the stack of corner vertices (different slice behavior depending on normal, merge, split, start, and end vertices). Finally, the polygon is in Y-monotone chunks that are triangulated, with checks to preserve the manifold shape (again, based on vertex types). Now we have a fully triangulated DCEL.

Binary trees can have multiple entry points to the same sub-trees and get 'pruned' which reuses existing sub-trees from the previous binary tree, as long as the same sub-tree structure is still in the buffer.
