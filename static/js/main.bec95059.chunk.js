Second, the polygon is made Y-monotone, meaning traveling counter-clockwise on the left side and clockwise on the right sides never has an edge that is directed up. If an edge is directed up, it needs to be sliced based on the stack of corner vertices (different slice behavior depending on normal, merge, split, start, and end vertices). Finally, the polygon is in Y-monotone chunks that are triangulated, with checks to preserve the manifold shape (again, based on vertex types). Now we have a fully triangulated DCEL.
