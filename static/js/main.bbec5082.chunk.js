When the app starts the position and rotation of the world change, so it would have to be started in the exact same position and rotation. To fix this we use the compass from Apple Core Motion to align the world so it doesn't matter how we start and it adjusts automatically. Another challenge was how to make the map and navigation data. We had floor plans and tried measuring it out, but a better solution we implemented was a mapping tool so the whole floor can be mapped out on the iPad alone, exported, and reused later."}]},{sku:"GEO",title:"Mesh Triangulation and Point Location",topic:"Computational Geometry",short:"Processing and querying triangulation",icon:"",cover:"GEO-1.png",article:[{p:"Computational Geometry was one of my favorite classes.

First, the points are made into an outer hull which is a polygon with one face. Second, the polygon is made Y-monotone, meaning traveling counter-clockwise on the left side and clockwise on the right sides never has an edge that is directed up. If an edge is directed up, it needs to be sliced based on the stack of corner vertices (different slice behavior depending on normal, merge, split, start, and end vertices). Finally, the polygon is in Y-monotone chunks that are triangulated, with checks to preserve the manifold shape (again, based on vertex types). Now we have a fully triangulated DCEL. Triangulation is done in n log n time where the longest step is sorting.",img:"GEO-1.png",c:"A triangulated mesh"},{h:"Coding Extra Tools to Save Time Later",p:"To output our mesh, we were required to print a list of each vertex, edge, face, and their connected components. This takes quite a long time to draw out on paper and check the answer. To make my life easier, I wrote a .obj exporter, which would make a 3D file of my mesh and I could tell within a few seconds if it was correct. I am certain I saved many hours of drawing polygons out by hand by writing this tool, and I was the only student who had ever done this for the assignment. I also have far more confidence with my algorithm's accuracy because I could test significantly larger point clouds with ease, therefore testing more edge cases that only show up in uniquely shaped polygons with many points and hundreds of component references.",img:"GEO-2.png",c:"All components for ONE triangle printed in the terminal"},{h:"Point Location Data Structure",p:"The last part of this project was to query a coordinate and return what edge, face, or vertex the coordinate was located on. The data structure for querying points is a persistent binary tree. It is constructed by doing a planar sweep of edges, and makes a binary tree at the 'time' of that edge. Binary trees can have multiple entry points to the same sub-trees and get 'pruned' which reuses existing sub-trees from the previous binary tree, as long as the same sub-tree structure is still in the buffer. This persistence and reuse of sub-trees results in a smaller data structure of approximately n log n in size. A coordinate can be queried for the vertex, edge, or face that contains it in log n time by binary search. Queries are given 3D markers and exported with the .obj mesh.",img:"GEO-3.png",c:"Query coordinates on the mesh"}]},{sku:"RR",title:"Realm Raiders",topic:"HoloLens Prototype",short:"Tower defense all around you",icon:"",cover:"RR-1.png",article:[{h:"Making Games for HoloLens",p:"Realm Raiders is a prototype for a Microsoft HoloLens game.
