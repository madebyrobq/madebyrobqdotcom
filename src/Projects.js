This project is designed to extend an existing product used for conducting surveys around the hospital, which is often done by volunteers who have limited knowledge of the building and could work much more efficiently with AR guided directions.",

To fix this we use the compass from Apple Core Motion to align the world so it doesn't matter how we start and it adjusts automatically. Another challenge was how to make the map and navigation data. We had floor plans and tried measuring it out, but a better solution we implemented was a mapping tool so the whole floor can be mapped out on the iPad alone, exported, and reused later.",

First, the points are made into an outer hull which is a polygon with one face. Second, the polygon is made Y-monotone, meaning traveling counter-clockwise on the left side and clockwise on the right sides never has an edge that is directed up. If an edge is directed up, it needs to be sliced based on the stack of corner vertices (different slice behavior depending on normal, merge, split, start, and end vertices). Finally, the polygon is in Y-monotone chunks that are triangulated, with checks to preserve the manifold shape (again, based on vertex types). Now we have a fully triangulated DCEL. Triangulation is done in n log n time where the longest step is sorting.",

I am certain I saved many hours of drawing polygons out by hand by writing this tool, and I was the only student who had ever done this for the assignment. I also have far more confidence with my algorithm's accuracy because I could test significantly larger point clouds with ease, therefore testing more edge cases that only show up in uniquely shaped polygons with many points and hundreds of component references.",

Binary trees can have multiple entry points to the same sub-trees and get 'pruned' which reuses existing sub-trees from the previous binary tree, as long as the same sub-tree structure is still in the buffer. This persistence and reuse of sub-trees results in a smaller data structure of approximately n log n in size. A coordinate can be queried for the vertex, edge, or face that contains it in log n time by binary search. Queries are given 3D markers and exported with the .obj mesh.",
